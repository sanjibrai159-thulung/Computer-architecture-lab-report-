# Discussion and Conclusion

In this laboratory experiment, the VHDL implementation of basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR) was successfully completed using GHDL and GTKWave. The design files and testbench were compiled, elaborated, and simulated without errors.

The simulation results verified that the output of each logic gate matched its expected truth table for all input combinations. The GTKWave waveform confirmed the correct operation of every gate.

This experiment provided practical knowledge of VHDL programming, digital logic design, simulation, and waveform analysis. Hence, the objectives of the experiment were successfully achieved.
