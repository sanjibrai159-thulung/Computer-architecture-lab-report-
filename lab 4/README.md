# Discussion and Conclusion

In this laboratory experiment, a 4-to-1 Multiplexer and a 1-to-4 Demultiplexer were successfully designed and implemented using VHDL. The circuits were compiled, elaborated, and simulated using GHDL, and the resulting waveforms were analyzed using GTKWave.

The simulation results confirmed that the multiplexer correctly selected one of the four input signals based on the select lines, while the demultiplexer correctly routed the input signal to the selected output line according to the select inputs. The observed waveforms matched the expected outputs.

This experiment improved the understanding of combinational circuit design, multiplexing and demultiplexing operations, VHDL programming, simulation, and waveform analysis. Hence, the objectives of the experiment were successfully achieved.
